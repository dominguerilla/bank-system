There is a max client input size of 40 chars, which is checked in two ways:
1. The client checks if the total size of getline() is >= 40
2. The server, using sscanf, gets two strings from any input sent by client
The issue is when the client's input has more than two 'tokens'--i.e. there is more than one space character in the input
WORKAROUND: As the client, make sure your input has no more than one space character
